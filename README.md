1. Introduction

Traffic accidents are a major public health and safety concern in Turkey. This project aims to investigate the potential relationship between education levels and traffic collision rates in different regions of Turkey. By analyzing data on educational levels and traffic accidents (deadly or not), we can identify correlations between education levels and traffic accidents, finally putting an end to the much-repeated question: "Are bad drivers uneducated?" Istanbul is most likely to be excluded from the dataset due to its heavy immigration from other cities, but it will be considered separately.

2. Objectives

a) To determine if there is any relationship between driving responsibly and education.
b) To analyze any regional variations between the 7 districts of Turkey.
c) To determine if the quality of infrastructure affects traffic-related accidents.

3. Methods

a) Traffic data will be extracted from TÜİK.
b) Educational data will be extracted from MEB, but TÜİK has similar data. In that case, newer or cleaner data will be used.
c) The quality of traffic infrastructure and the age of cars are factors as well. To determine the factor of car age, we will use how many cars are sold per thousand, and for traffic infrastructure, we will use how much money has been spent on infrastructure over the past * years to account for and correct these factors as well.

4. the plan
We will cross examine the data we got from TUIK and MEB to determine if educations effects traffic accidents on a per city basis.
